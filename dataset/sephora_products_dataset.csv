So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*
