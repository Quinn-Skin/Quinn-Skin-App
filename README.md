## Overview
### Description

It is not easy that we all need to navigate our lives with the quarantine situation around the globe -- disrupted workout routine, balancing work and school life to prevent burnouts, and all those irregular breakouts popped up overnight is probably the last thing we want before all these zoom meetings. Donâ€™t we all want to take good care of ourselves and present our best face in front of others?

Quinn is a mobile app to recommend clean skincare products for men. Users take a five-question survey regarding their skin concerns, and the app will recommend them a curated selection of products, such as some essentials for men: facial cleanser, moisturizer,and suncare.

At Quinn, our goal is to help you build a healthy and easy-to-follow skincare routine. No more confusion and frustration. Want a glowy skin for your next zoom meeting? Come and join Quinn!

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Skincare, Wellness,and Social
- **Mobile:** The MVP version of Quinn recommends products by taking the survey answers as inputs and incorporating a content-based recommender model at the backend to understand their skincare needs better. After taking the survey, users will receive details on the recommended product, such as product description, product image, price, and a product link to the e-commerce site. Eventually, Quinn aims to add product reviews, calendar-based skin monitoring, experience, or other social sharing functions into the app.

- **Story:** Users start by answering a five-question survey,including skin concern, skin type, products, and budget. Quinn provides users a detailed page on the recommended product. Users could then choose to click on 'take the survey' to search for another product or click on the 'visit product' link to purchase the product on an e-commerce site.

- **Market:** Quinn targets men's skincare market. According to our research and experiences, the men's skincare market is largely untapped and has a great market potential post-COVID. Shopping for men's skincare products are confusing and overwhelming to many people, even to girls. We see Quinn as a solution for various users, not just skincare junkies looking for products for their skin, but also women looking for skincare products for the important males in their life!

- **Habit:** We see Quinn's usage peaks around the holiday season when people are shopping for their families, friends, and loved ones. We also project a higher use around anniversaries, birthdays, and the change of seasons (subjected to an individual user)

- **Scope:** The main feature for Quinn is to provide product recommendations. Currently, it will present the recommended product one at a time. We hope to expand it to offer an entire three-product routine all at once in the future without having users taking the survey over and over again. And add the features mentioned in the mobile section above.
